# Frontend Changes

## Summary
Enhanced the existing testing framework for the RAG system with essential API testing infrastructure. Since this enhancement is focused on backend API testing rather than frontend functionality, there are no direct frontend changes made. However, the improvements ensure better reliability and testing coverage for the APIs that the frontend depends on.

## Changes Made

### 1. pytest Configuration (pyproject.toml)
- Added `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section with comprehensive test configuration
- Configured test discovery patterns and execution options
- Added custom markers for test categorization (unit, integration, api, slow)
- Added httpx dependency for API testing support

### 2. Enhanced Test Fixtures (backend/tests/conftest.py)
- Added new imports for FastAPI testing: `TestClient`, `patch`, `Generator`
- Created `mock_rag_system` fixture for API testing with comprehensive mocking
- Created `test_app` fixture that replicates the main app structure without static file mounting issues
- Created `test_client` fixture that properly injects mocked dependencies
- Added sample API request/response fixtures for consistent test data

### 3. API Endpoint Tests (backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py)
- Comprehensive test suite covering all three main endpoints:
  - `/` (root endpoint)
  - `/api/query` (query processing)
  - `/api/courses` (course statistics)
- Tests cover various scenarios:
  - Happy path testing
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Request validation
  - Response format validation
  - CORS and header verification
  - Unicode content handling
  - Large response handling
  - Session management
- Integration tests for complete API workflows
- Proper test categorization using pytest markers

## Technical Solutions

### Static File Mounting Issue Resolution
The main FastAPI app in `backend/app.py` mounts static files from `../frontend` directory, which doesn't exist in the test environment. This was resolved by:

1. Creating a separate test app (`test_app` fixture) that replicates the API endpoints without static file mounting
2. Using dependency injection to provide mocked RAG system to the test endpoints
3. Maintaining the same middleware configuration (CORS, TrustedHost) for realistic testing

### Testing Architecture
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing (existing)
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **API Tests**: Full endpoint testing with mocked dependencies
- **Fixtures**: Shared test data and mocked dependencies for consistency

## Impact on Frontend
While no direct frontend changes were made, these enhancements provide:
- More reliable API endpoints that the frontend depends on
- Better error handling and validation
- Comprehensive test coverage ensuring API stability
- Confidence in API behavior for frontend integration

## Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run only API tests
uv run pytest -m api

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -v

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py
```

## Notes
- All tests are designed to work with the existing RAG system architecture
- Mocking ensures tests run independently without requiring actual document loading or AI API calls
- Test configuration allows for easy categorization and selective test execution
- The framework is extensible for future API endpoint additions
